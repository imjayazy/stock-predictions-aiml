The primary goal of the stock predictions project was to develop and deploy machine learning models capable of forecasting stock prices. The project aimed to provide actionable insights for financial decision-making and investment strategies by leveraging historical data and advanced analytical techniques.
Data Sources: Historical stock price data, including open, close, high, low, and volume metrics, was gathered from financial databases and APIs. Additional economic indicators and market sentiment data were incorporated to enrich the feature set.
Data Cleaning: The data was meticulously cleaned to handle missing values, outliers, and anomalies. This ensured the integrity and reliability of the dataset for model training.
Model Development:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted EDA to understand the underlying patterns and relationships within the data. This involved visualizing correlations and trends to guide the model selection process.
Model Selection: Evaluated various machine learning algorithms including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and more sophisticated approaches like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for time series forecasting.
Model Training: Models were trained on historical data, with hyperparameters tuned using techniques such as Grid Search and Cross-Validation to optimize performance.
Validation: The models were validated using a separate validation set to assess their predictive accuracy. Metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) were used to measure performance.
Technologies and Tools Used:
Programming Languages: Python for data analysis and model development.
Libraries and Frameworks: Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation, Scikit-Learn for traditional machine learning models, and TensorFlow/Keras for deep learning models.
Data Visualization: Matplotlib and Seaborn for exploratory analysis and results visualization.
